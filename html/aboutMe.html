<ul>
    Hey there. My name is Lauren Alexander, and I'm a student at Washington University in St. Louis 
    (expected graduation May 2024). I'm double majoring in Computer Science & Art History and Archaeology,
    with a minor in Human-Computer Interaction.
</ul>
<ul>
    I am currently working as a Web Developer at the Skandalaris Center, my school's entrepreneurship hub, 
    where I design websites for student-run startups. I also work as a Museum Attendant at the Kemper Art Museum.
</ul>
<ul>
    Previously, I worked as a Legal Intern at Harmon, Linder & Rogowsky (Summer 2022). I was also a TA for CSE 247: 
    Data Structures and Algorithms (Fall 2021), where I led in-class studios of nine students, graded assignments, and  
    worked one-on-one with students, debugging their code to identify errors in their solutions.
</ul>
<ul>
    My hobbies include investing in stocks, investing in art with Masterworks, making playlists for friends and family, and playing guitar.
