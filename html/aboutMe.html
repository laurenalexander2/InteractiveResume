    </div>
<ul>
    My name is Lauren Alexander, and I'm a student at Washington University in St. Louis (expected graduation May 2024). 
    I am double majoring in Computer Science and Art History. 
</ul>
<ul>
    I have full stack and backend experience, and am proficient in Java, C++, HTML, and CSS. 
    I also have experience handling data with Python and SQL. 
</ul>
<ul>
    This past summer I worked as a PRE Intern out of Palantir's NYC office. In this role I implemented Hyperion monitors to track endpoint latencies, handled my team's metric migration from Datadog to Grafana, and was my team's first responder to P1s - P3s.
</ul>
<ul>
    During my junior year I worked as a Web Developer at the Skandalaris Center, my school's entrepreneurship hub, 
    where I designed websites for student-run startups using HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Figma. I also work as a Museum Attendant at the Kemper Art Museum in St. Louis.
</ul>
<ul>
    Previously, as a TA for Data Structures and Algorithms (Fall 2021), I led in-class studios of eleven students, graded assignments, and  
    worked one-on-one with students, debugging their code to identify errors in their solutions.
</ul>
<ul>
    I am very passionate about Art History, especially feminist critiques, Northern Renaissance prints, and the 1960s/1970s Avant-garde scene in New York. I love reading and writing about art, and hope to explore the ways computational technologies might enhance traditional scholarship.
</ul>
<ul>
    Outside of school, I am passionate about biopics, small art museums, concerts, indy video game developing, gifting playlists to friends and family, printmaking, preserving coral reefs, and playing guitar.
</ul>
