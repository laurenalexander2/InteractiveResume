    Hi! My name is Lauren Alexander, and I'm a student at Washington University in St. Louis (expected graduation May 2024). 
    I am double majoring in Computer Science and Art History, with a minor in Human-Computer Interaction. 
</ul>
<ul>
    I have both full stack and backend experience, and am proficient in Java, C++, HTML, and CSS. 
    I also have experience handling data with Python and SQL. 
</ul>
<ul>
    This past year, I worked as a Web Developer at the Skandalaris Center, my school's entrepreneurship hub, 
    where I designed websites for student-run startups using HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Figma. I also worked as a Museum Attendant at the Kemper Art Museum in St. Louis.
</ul>
<ul>
    Previously, I worked as a Legal Intern at Harmon, Linder & Rogowsky (Summer 2022) in New York, where I corresponded with clients and 
    assisted my coworkers with shared office technology. As a TA for 
    Data Structures and Algorithms (Fall 2021), I led in-class studios of nine students, graded assignments, and  
    worked one-on-one with students, debugging their code to identify errors in their solutions.
</ul>
<ul>
    I am very passionate about Art History, especially the 1960s New York Avant-garde scene and feminist critiques.
    Outside of school, my hobbies include investing in stocks, investing in art with Masterworks, gifting playlists to friends and family, and playing guitar.
</ul>

<ul>
    With technology, we have the opportunity to create a more efficient, sustainable, and equitable future. 
    I am very grateful for the educational and professional opportunities I have been afforded. I am commited to using what I've learned from these opportunities to make a positive, tangible difference.
    This summer I will be working as a PRE Intern out of Palantir's NYC office. Ultimately, I hope to pursure a high-impact role at a mission driven company.
