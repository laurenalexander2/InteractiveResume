    </div>
<ul>
    My name is Lauren Alexander, and I'm a student at Washington University in St. Louis (expected graduation May 2024). 
    I am double majoring in Computer Science and Art History. 
</ul>
<ul>
    I have full-stack and backend experience and am proficient in Java, Python, and web dev technologies (React, Typescript, HTML, and CSS). 
</ul>
<ul>
    This past summer, I worked as a PRE Intern out of Palantir's NYC office. In this role I led
    monitoring and metrics initiatives to provide visibility into backend services, detecting latency and regression before user impact.
</ul>
<ul>
    During my junior year, I worked as a Web Developer at the Skandalaris Center, my school's entrepreneurship hub, 
    where I designed websites for student-run startups using HTML/CSS, React, and Typescript. I also worked as a Museum Attendant at the Kemper Art Museum in St. Louis.
</ul>
<ul>
    Previously, as a TA for Data Structures and Algorithms (Fall 2021), I led in-class studios of nine students, graded assignments, and hosted office hours,
    working one-on-one with students to debug their code and identify errors in their solutions.
</ul>
<ul>
    I am passionate about art history, especially modern, experimental print practices, political readings of Surrealism, feminist critiques, and the 1960s/1970s avant-garde scene in New York. 
</ul>
<ul>
    Outside of school, I like international film, small, regional art museums, concerts, yoga, scuba diving, and playing guitar.
</ul>
